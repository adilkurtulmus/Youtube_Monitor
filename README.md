A comprehensive Grafana dashboard for real-time monitoring of YouTube live streams using Prometheus metrics. Track stream status, viewer counts, engagement metrics, and detect outages across multiple YouTube channels simultaneously.

üåü Features

Live Stream Status Monitoring: Real-time tracking of stream status (LIVE/OFFLINE)
Viewer Count Tracking: Monitor concurrent viewers for live streams
Outage Detection: Track and visualize stream outages over time
API Health Monitoring: Monitor YouTube API errors and response rates
Engagement Metrics: Track views, likes, comments, and engagement rates
Channel Stats: Monitor subscriber counts and other channel metrics
Multi-Stream Support: Monitor multiple streams/channels simultaneously
Historical Data: View historical performance with customizable time ranges

üìã Requirements

Grafana 11.x or later
Prometheus data source
Python 3.6+
YouTube Data API v3 key
prometheus_client and requests Python libraries

üîß Installation
Step 1: Set Up the Prometheus YouTube Exporter

Clone this repository:
bashCopygit clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-stream-monitoring.git
cd youtube-stream-monitoring

Install required Python dependencies:
bashCopypip install prometheus_client requests

Configure your YouTube API key and channels:

Obtain a YouTube Data API v3 key from Google Cloud Console
Edit prometheus_youtube_exporter.py and update the streams list with your channels


Run the exporter:
bashCopypython prometheus_youtube_exporter.py
The exporter runs on port 8001 by default. You can access metrics at http://localhost:8001

Step 2: Configure Prometheus
Add the following to your prometheus.yml configuration:
yamlCopyscrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'youtube'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8001']
    scrape_interval: 30s
Restart Prometheus to apply the changes.
Step 3: Import the Grafana Dashboard
There are two ways to import the dashboard:
Option 1: Import via Grafana.com

In Grafana, go to "Create" > "Import"
Enter dashboard ID: 23108
Select your Prometheus data source
Click "Import"

Option 2: Import JSON Directly

In Grafana, go to "Create" > "Import"
Click "Upload JSON file" and select youtube_stream_monitoring_dashboard.json from this repository
Select your Prometheus data source
Click "Import"

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Exporter Configuration
The exporter is configured through the streams list in 

prometheus_youtube_exporter.py:

    {
        'name': 'Main_Channel',        # A unique name for the stream
        'channel_name': 'Channel Name', # Display name
        'channel_id': 'UCxxxxxxxx',    # YouTube channel ID
        'video_id': 'xxxxxxxxxxx',     # YouTube video/stream ID
        'api_key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',     # YouTube API key
        'environment': 'Production'    # Environment tag
    },
    # Add more streams as needed


Metrics Check Frequency
You can adjust how often metrics are checked by modifying the interval parameter:
pythonCopy# Change the interval from 30 seconds to your preferred value (in seconds)
thread = threading.Thread(target=run_monitor, args=(stream, metrics, 30))
API Usage Optimization
The exporter is designed to minimize API usage:

Stream status is checked every cycle (default: 30 seconds)
Engagement metrics (views, likes) are checked every 5 cycles
Channel information (subscribers) is checked every 10 cycles

Available Metrics:

Dashboard Panels: 
Main Metrics

YouTube Stream Status: Current stream status (LIVE/OFFLINE)
Outages in Last 24 Hours: Count of stream outages in the last 24 hours
API Errors: Count of YouTube API errors in the last 24 hours
Total Check Count: Number of checks performed
API Error Rate: Percentage of API errors compared to total checks
YouTube Stream Uptime: 24-hour stream uptime percentage

Viewership and Engagement

YouTube Viewer Count: Real-time and historical viewer count graph
YouTube Stream Status Timeline: Timeline of stream status changes
Engagement Metrics: Views, likes, comments counts
Subscriber Count: Real-time channel subscriber count
Engagement Rate: Percentage of viewers who engaged with the stream

üêõ Troubleshooting
Common Issues
No Metrics Showing

Verify the exporter is running (curl http://localhost:8001)
Check Prometheus target status in Prometheus UI
Verify your YouTube API key is valid

API Errors

Your API key might have exceeded its quota
Reduce check frequency to stay within API limits
Create a new API key with higher quotas

Dashboard Shows "No Data"

Verify Prometheus is scraping the exporter correctly
Check for label matching issues in dashboard queries
Restart the exporter and verify metrics are being generated

Missing Stream Status

Verify the video ID is correct and is a live stream
Make sure the channel has public statistics enabled

üìå Installation as a System Service
For production environments, you may want to run the exporter as a system service:
Linux (systemd)
Create a service file at /etc/systemd/system/youtube-exporter.service:
iniCopy[Unit]
Description=YouTube Prometheus Exporter
After=network.target

[Service]
User=prometheus
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/prometheus_youtube_exporter.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Then enable and start the service:
bashCopysudo systemctl enable youtube-exporter
sudo systemctl start youtube-exporter
Docker Installation
You can also run the exporter in Docker:
bashCopydocker build -t youtube-exporter .
docker run -d -p 8001:8001 --name youtube-exporter youtube-exporter
üìù Customizing the Dashboard
You can customize the dashboard to fit your needs:

Add or remove panels
Adjust thresholds for status indicators
Create additional alerts
